# KeyFinder

## Design Approach

## Player Control and Solving the puzzle
You can control the player using the arrow keys or WASD, and look around by dragging the mouse.

Player Tip: A mini-map is located in the bottom right corner of the screen, showing key locations.

Mini-Map Details: Orange spheres indicate key locations, the purple cube marks the door, and the red arrow shows the player's position and direction.

Save Feature: The game automatically saves when a key is found. If the player exits the game, they can resume from the last checkpoint when they start it again.
